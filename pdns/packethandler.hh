/** Central DNS logic according to RFC1034. Ask this class a question in the form of a DNSPacket
    and it will return, synchronously, a DNSPacket answer, suitable for

    The PacketHandler gives your question to the PacketCache for possible inclusion
    in the cache.

    In order to do so, the PacketHandler contains a reference to the global extern PacketCache PC

    It also contains an UeberBackend instance for answering the subqueries needed to generate
    a complete reply.
