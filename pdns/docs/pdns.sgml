    <Title>The PowerDNS dynamic nameserver</Title>

    <Para>
      The PowerDNS daemon is a versatile nameserver which supports a large number
      of backends. These backends can either be <link linkend="bindbackend">plain zonefiles</link> or be 
      <link linkend="pipebackend">more dynamic</link> in nature. 
    </Para>
    
    <Para>
      Prime examples of backends include relational databases, but also
      loadbalancing and failover algorithms. 
    </Para>
    <para>
      The company is called PowerDNS BV, the nameserver daemon is called PDNS.
    </para>

    <sect1 id="function-design"><title>Function &amp; design of PDNS</title>
      <para>
	PDNS is an authoritative only nameserver. It will answer questions about domains it knows about, 
	but will not go out on the net to resolve queries about other domains. However, it can use a 
	<link linkend="recursion">recursing backend</link> to provide that functionality.
      </para>
      <para>
	When PDNS answers a question, it comes out of the database, and can be trusted as being authoritative. There is
	no way to pollute the cache or to confuse the daemon. 
      </para>
      <para>
	PDNS has been designed to serve both the needs of small installations by being easy to setup, as well as 
	for serving very large query volumes on large numbers of domains.
      </para>
      <para>
	Another prime goal is <link linkend="security">security</link>. By the use of language features, the PDNS source code 
	is very small (in the order of  10.000 lines) which makes auditing easy. In the same way, library features have been used 
	to mitigate the risks of buffer overflows.
      </para>
      <para>
	Finally, PDNS is able to give a lot of <link linkend="monitoring">statistics</link> on its operation which is both helpful in 
	determining the scalability of an installation as well as for spotting problems.
      </para>

	  The 'million domains' release - PowerDNS has now firmly established itself as a major player with the 
	  unofficial count (ie, guesswork) now at over two million PowerDNS domains! Also, the GeoBackend has been tested
	  by a big website and may soon see wider deployment. Thanks to Mark Bergsma for spreading the word!

		When running chroot()ed and with master or slave support active, PowerDNS needs to resolve domain names

	      There appears to be a problem with PowerDNS on Red Hat 7.3 with GCC 2.96 and self-compiled binaries. The symptoms are

	<para>
	  There have been a number of reports on MySQL connections being dropped on FreeBSD 4.x, which sometimes causes PowerDNS to give up and reload itself. 
	  To combat this, MySQL error messages have been improved in some places in hopes of figuring out what is up. The initial indication is 
	  that MySQL itself sometimes terminates the connection and, amazingly, that switching to a Unix domain socket instead of TCP solves
	  the problem.

	  This is a sweeping release in the sense of cleanup. There are some new features but mostly a lot of cleanup going on. Hiding inside is the 
	  <filename>bind2backend</filename>, the next generation of the bind backend. A work in progress. Those of you with overlapping zones,
	  as mentioned in the changelog of 2.9.6, are invited to check it out by replacing <command>launch=bind</command>
	  by <command>launch=bind2</command> and renaming all <command>bind-</command> parameters to
	  <command>bind2-</command>. Be aware that if you run with many small zones, this backend is faster, but if you run with a few large ones, it is slower. This will improve.

      <sect2 id="changelog-2-9-6"><title>Version 2.9.6</title>	
	<para>
	  Two new backends - Generic ODBC (windows only) and LDAP. Furthermore, a few important bugs have been fixed which may have hampered sites seeing a lot of 
	  outgoing zonetransfers. Additionally, the pdns recursor now has 'query throttling' which is pretty cool. In short this makes sure that PowerDNS 
	  does not send out heaps of queries if a nameserver is unable to provide an answer. Many operators of authoritative setups are all too aware of 
	  recursing nameservers that hammer them for zones they don't have, PowerDNS won't do that anymore now, no matter what clients request of it.

      <sect2 id="changelog-2-9-5"><title>Version 2.9.5</title>	
	<para>
	  Released on 2002-02-03.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This version is almost entirely about recursion with major changes to both the pdns recursor, which is renamed to 
	  '<filename>pdns_recursor</filename>' and to the main PowerDNS binary to make it interact better with the recursing component.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Sadly, due to <ulink url="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2003-01/msg00245.html">technical reasons</ulink>, compiling
	  the pdns recursor and pdns authoritative nameserver into one binary is not immediately possible. During the release of 2.9.4 we
	  stated that the recursing nameserver would be integrated in the next release - this won't happen now.
	</para>
	<para>
	  However, this turns out to not be that bad at all. The recursor can now be restarted without having to restart the rest of the nameserver,
	  for example. Cooperation between the both halves of PDNS is also almost seamless. As a result, 'non-lazy recursion' has been dropped. See
	  <xref linkend="recursion"> for more details.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Furthermore, the recursor only works on Linux, Windows and Solaris (not entirely). FreeBSD does not support the required functions.
	  If you know any important FreeBSD people, plea with them to support set/get/swapcontext! Alternatively, FreeBSD coders could read
	  the solution presented here <ulink url="http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~ejones/software/threading.html">in figure 5</ulink>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The 'Contributor of the Month' award goes to Mark Bergsma who has responded to our plea for help with the label compressor and contributed
	  a wonderfully simple and right fix that allows PDNS to compress just as well as Other namerervers out there. An honorary mention goes to
	  Ueli Heuer who, despite having no C++ experience, submitted an excellent SRV record implementation.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Excellent work was also performed by Michel Stol, the Windows guy, in fixing all our non-portable stuff again. Christof Meerwald has also done 
	  wonderful work in porting MTasker to Windows, which was then used by Michel to get the recursor functioning on Windows.

      <sect2 id="changelog-2-9-4"><title>Version 2.9.4</title>	
	<para>
	  Yet another grand release. Big news is the addition of a recursing nameserver which has sprung into existence
	  over the past week. It is in use on several computers already but it is not ready for prime time. Complete integration
	  with PowerDNS is expected around 2.9.5, for now the recursor is a separate program. 
	</para>
	<para>
	  In preliminary tests, the recursor appears to be four times faster than BIND 9 on a naive benchmark starting from a cold cache. BIND 9
	  managed to get through to some slower nameservers however, which were given up on by PowerDNS. We will continue to tune the recursor.
	  See <xref linkend="built-in-recursor"> for further details.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The BIND Backend has also been tested (see the <command>bind-domain-status</command> item below) rather heavily by several parties. After some
	  discussion online, one of the BIND authors ventured that the newsgroup comp.protocols.dns.bind may now in fact be an appropriate venue
	  for discussing PowerDNS. Since this discussion, traffic to the PowerDNS pages has increased sixfold and shows no signs of slowing down.
	</para>
	<para>
	  From this, it is apparent that far more people are interested in PowerDNS than yet know about it. So spread the word!

	<para>
	  Broad range of huge improvements. We now have an all-static .rpm and .deb for Linux users and a a link to an OpenBSD port.
	  Major news is that work on the Bind backend has progressed to the point that we've just retired our last Bind server and 
	  replaced it with PowerDNS in Bind mode! This server is operating a number of master and slave setups so it should stress the Bind backend 
	  somewhat.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This version is rapidly approaching the point where it is a better-Bind-than-Bind and nearly a drop-in replacement for authoritative 
	  setups. PowerDNS is now equipped with a powerful 
	  master/slave apparatus that offers a lot of insight and control to the user, even when operating from Bind zonefiles and a 
	  Bind configuration. Observe.
	</para>
	<para>
	  After the SOA of ds9a.nl was raised:
	  <screen>
pdns[17495]: All slave domains are fresh
pdns[17495]: 1 domain for which we are master needs notifications
pdns[17495]: Queued notification of domain 'ds9a.nl' to 195.193.163.3
pdns[17495]: Queued notification of domain 'ds9a.nl' to 213.156.2.1
pdns[17520]: AXFR of domain 'ds9a.nl' initiated by 195.193.163.3
pdns[17520]: AXFR of domain 'ds9a.nl' to 195.193.163.3 finished
pdns[17521]: AXFR of domain 'ds9a.nl' initiated by 213.156.2.1
pdns[17521]: AXFR of domain 'ds9a.nl' to 213.156.2.1 finished
pdns[17495]: Removed from notification list: 'ds9a.nl' to 195.193.163.3 (was acknowledged)
pdns[17495]: Removed from notification list: 'ds9a.nl' to 213.156.2.1 (was acknowledged)
pdns[17495]: No master domains need notifications
	  </screen>
	  If however our slaves would ignore us, as some are prone to do, we can send some additional notifications:
	  <screen>
$ sudo pdns_control notify ds9a.nl         
Added to queue
pdns[17492]: Notification request for domain 'ds9a.nl' received
pdns[17492]: Queued notification of domain 'ds9a.nl' to 195.193.163.3
pdns[17492]: Queued notification of domain 'ds9a.nl' to 213.156.2.1
pdns[17495]: Removed from notification list: 'ds9a.nl' to 195.193.163.3 (was acknowledged)
pdns[17495]: Removed from notification list: 'ds9a.nl' to 213.156.2.1 (was acknowledged)
	    </screen>
	  Conversely, if PowerDNS needs to be reminded to retrieve a zone from a master, a command is provided:
           <screen>
$ sudo pdns_control retrieve forfun.net
Added retrieval request for 'forfun.net' from master 212.187.98.67
pdns[17495]: AXFR started for 'forfun.net', transaction started
pdns[17495]: Zone 'forfun.net' (/var/cache/bind/forfun.net) reloaded 
pdns[17495]: AXFR done for 'forfun.net', zone committed
	  </screen>
	  Also, you can force PowerDNS to reload a zone from disk immediately with <command>pdns_control bind-reload-now</command>.
	  All this happens 'live', per your instructions. Without instructions, the right things also happen, but the operator is in charge.
	</para>
	<para>
	  For more about all this coolness, see <xref linkend="pdnscontrol"> and <xref linkend="bind-control-commands">.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <warning>
	    <para>
	      Again some changes in compilation instructions. The hybrid pgmysql backend has been split up into 'gmysql' and 'gpgsql', sharing
	      a common base within the PowerDNS server itself. This means that you can no longer compile 
	      <command>--with-modules="pgmysql" --enable-mysql --enable-pgsql</command> but that you should now use:
	      <command>--with-modules="gmysql gpgsql"</command>. The old launch-names remain available. 
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      If you launch the Generic PgSQL backend as gpgsql2, all parameters will have gpsql2 as a prefix, for example 
	      <command>pgsql2-dbname</command>. If launched as gpsql, the regular names are in effect.
	    </para>
	  </warning>
	</para>
	<para>
	  <warning>
	    <para>
	      The pdns_control protocol was changed which means that older pdns_controls cannot talk to 2.9.3. The other way around is
	      broken too. This may lead to problems with automatic upgrade scripts, so pay attention if your daemon is truly restarted.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Also make sure no old pdns_control command is around to confuse things.

	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="changelog-2-6"><title>Version 2.6</title>
	<para>
	  Performance release. A lot of work has been done to raise PDNS performance to staggering levels in order to take part
	  in benchmarketing efforts. Together with our as yet unnamed partner, PDNS has been benchmarked at 60.000 mostly cached queries/second
	  on off the shelf PC hardware. Uncached performance was 17.000 uncached DNS queries/second on the .ORG domain.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Performance has been increased by both making PDNS itself quicker but also by lowering the number of backend queries typically needed. Operators
	  will typically see PDNS taking less CPU and the backend seeing less load.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Furthermore, some real bugs were fixed. A couple of undocumented performance switches may appear in --help output but you are advised to stay
	  away from these.

      <sect2 id="changelog-2-5"><title>Version 2.5</title>
	<para>
	  An important release which has seen quite a lot of trial and error testing. As a result, PDNS can now run with a huge cache
	  and concurrent invalidations. This is useful when running of a slower database or under high traffic load with a fast database.

	  Furthermore, the gpgsql2 backend has been validated for use and will soon supplant the gpgsql backend entirely. This also bodes 
	  well for the gmysql backend which is the same code.

	  Also, a large amount of issues biting large scale slave operators were addressed. Most of these issues would only show up

	<para>
	  New features:
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Query cache. The old Packet Cache only cached entire questions and their answers. This is very CPU efficient but
		does not lead to maximum hitrate. Two packets both needing to resolve smtp.you.com internally would not benefit 
		from any caching. Furthermore, many different DNS queries lead to the same backend queries, like 'SOA for .COM?'.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		PDNS now also caches backend queries, but only those having no answer (the majority) and those having one answer 
		(almost the rest). 
	      </para>
	      <para>
		In tests, these additional caches appear to halve the database backend load numerically and perhaps even more in terms
		of CPU load. Often, queries with no answer are more expensive than those having one.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		The default <command>ttl</command>s for the query-cache and negquery-cache are set to safe values (20 and 60 seconds
		respectively), you should be seeing an improvement in behaviour without sacrificing a lot in terms of quick updates.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		The webserver also displays the efficiency of the new Query Cache.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		The old Packet Cache is still there (and useful) but see <xref linkend="performance"> for more details.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		There is now the ability to shut off some logging at a very early stage. High performance sites doing thousands of 
		queries/second may in fact spend most of their CPU time on attempting to write out logging, even though it is ignored
		by syslog. The new flag <command>log-dns-details</command>, on by default, allows the operator to kill most 
		informative-only logging before it takes any cpu.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Flags which can be switched 'on' and 'off' can now also be set to 'off' instead of only to 'no' to turn them off.
	      </para>

	</para>
	<para>
	  Enhancements:
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Packet Cache is now case insensitive, leading to a higher hitrate because identical queries only differing in case
		now both match. Care is taken to restore the proper case in the answer sent out.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Packet Cache stores packets more efficiently now, savings are estimated at 50%. 
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		The Packet Cache is now asynchronous which means that PDNS continues to answer questions while the cache
		is busy being purged or queried. Incidentally this will mean a cache miss where previously the question would
		wait until the cache became available again. 
	      </para>
	      <para>
		The upshot of this is that operators can call <command>pdns_control purge</command> as often as desired without
		fearing performance loss. Especially the full, non-specific, purge was speeded up tremendously. 
	      </para>
	      <para>
		This optimization is of little merit for small sites but is very important when running with a large packetcache, such
		as when using recursion under high load.
	      </para>

		Recursive queries are now also cached, but in a separate namespace so non-recursive queries don't get recursed answers and
		vice versa. This should mean way lower database load for sites running with the current default lazy-recursion. Up to now,
		each and every recursive query would lead to a large amount of SQL queries.

	      Most users will run a static version of PDNS which has no dependencies on external libraries. However, some may need to run the dynamic version.
	      This warning applies to these users.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      To run the dynamic version of PDNS, which is needed for backend drivers which are only available in source form, gcc 3.0 is required.
	      RedHat 7.2 comes with gcc 3.0 as an optional component, RedHat 7.3 does not. However, the RedHat 7.2 Update gcc rpms install just fine
	      on RedHat 7.3. For Debian, we suggest running 'woody' and installing the g++-3.0 package. We expect to release a FreeBSD dynamic version
	      shortly.

<Sect1 id="testing">
<Title>Testing your install</Title>
      <para>
	After installing, it is a good idea to test the basic functionality of the software before configuring database backends.
	For this purpose, PowerDNS contains the 'bindbackend' which has a domain built in example.com, which is
	officially reserved for testing.

	To test, edit <filename>pdns.conf</filename> and add the following if not already present:
	
	<screen>
	  launch=bind
	  bind-example-zones
	</screen>

	This configures powerdns to 'launch' the bindbackend, and enable the example zones. To fire up PDNS in testing mode, execute: 
	<command>/etc/init.d/pdns monitor</command>, where you may have to substitute the location of your SysV init.d location you 
	specified earlier.

	In monitor mode, the pdns process runs in the foreground and is very verbose, which is perfect for testing your install.
	
	If everything went all right, you can query the example.com domain like this:
	<screen>
	  <command>host www.example.com 127.0.0.1</command>
	</screen>
	www.example.com should now have IP address 1.2.3.4. The <command>host</command> command can usually be found in the dnsutils 
	package of your operating system. Alternate command is: <command>dig www.example.com A @127.0.0.1</command> or even 
	<command>nslookup www.example.com 127.0.0.1</command>, although nslookup is not advised for DNS diagnostics.

	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  This means that another nameserver is listening on port 53 already. You can resolve this problem
		  by determining if it is safe to shutdown the nameserver already present, and doing so. If uncertain,
		  it is also possible to run PDNS on another port. To do so, add <command>local-port=5300</command> to
		  <filename>pdns.conf</filename>, and try again. This however implies that you can only test your nameserver
		  as clients expect the nameserver to live on port 53.

    <para>
    <note>
      <para>
	  PowerDNS support for Windows is, as of 1.99.12, very recent and therefore quite 'beta'. For reliability, we currently advise the use of 
	  the Unix versions. Furthermore there is no support for master or slave operation in the ODBC backend, which is the only one provided currently. 
	  This will be fixed soon.
      </para>

    </para>
    <para>
      As of 1.99.12, PowerDNS supports Windows natively. PDNS can act as an NT service and works with any ODBC drivers you may have.
    </para>
    <para>
      To install PowerDNS for Windows you should check if your PC meets the following requirements:
      <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	  <para>
	    A PC running Microsoft NT (with a recent servicepack and at least mdac 2.5), 2000 or XP.

	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>An ODBC source containing valid zone information (an example MS Access database is supplied in the form of <filename>powerdns.mdb</filename>).
    </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
    If your system meets these requirements, download the installer from <ulink url="http://www.powerdns.com/pdns/">http://www.powerdns.com/pdns/</ulink>.
    After downloading the file begin the installation procedure by starting <filename>powerdns-VERSION.exe</filename>.

  </para>

  <para>
    After installing the software you should create a valid ODBC source.
    To do this you have open the ODBC sources dialog: <filename>Start->Settings->Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Data Sources (ODBC)</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
    We'll use the example zone database that is included in the installation to explain how to create a source.
  </para>

  <para>
    When you are in the ODBC sources dialog you activate the <filename>System DSN</filename> tab. 
    <note><para>It is important to create a System DSN instead of an User DNS, otherwise the ODBC backend cannot function.</para></note>
  </para>

  <para>
    Press <filename>Add...</filename>, then you have to select a driver.

  <Chapter id="configuring-db-connection">
    <title>Configure database connectivity</title>
    <para>
      This chapter shows you how to configure the Generic MySQL backend, which we like a lot. But feel free to use any of the myriad
      other backends.
      This backend is called 'gmysql', and needs to be configured
      in <filename>pdns.conf</filename>. Add the following lines, adjusted for your local setup:
      
      <screen>
	launch=gmysql
	gmysql-host=127.0.0.1
	gmysql-user=root
	gmysql-dbname=pdnstest
      </screen>
      
      Remove any earlier <command>launch</command> statements. Also remove the <command>bind-example-zones</command>
      statement as the <command>bind</command> module is no longer launched.
    </para>
    <para>
      <warning>
	<para>
	  Make sure that you can actually resolve the hostname of your database without accessing the database! It is advised to supply
	  an IP address here to prevent chicken/egg problems!
	</para>
      </warning>
      <warning>
	<para>
	  Be very very sure that you configure the *g*mysql backend and not the mysql backend. See
	  <xref linkend="generic-mypgsql-backends">. If you use the 'mysql' backend things will only appear to work.
	</para>
      </warning>
    </para>
    <para>
      Now start PDNS using the monitor command:
      <screen>
	# /etc/init.d/pdns monitor
	(...)
	15:31:30 PowerDNS 1.99.0 (Mar 12 2002, 15:00:28) starting up

      This is as to be expected - we did not yet add anything to MySQL for PDNS to read from. At this point you may also see
      other errors which indicate that PDNS either could not find your MySQL server or was unable to connect to it. Fix these 
      before proceeding.

	<screen>
	  $ host www.test.com 127.0.0.1
	  www.test.com A record currently not present at localhost

	And indeed, the control console now shows:
	<screen>
	  Mar 12 15:41:12 We're not authoritative for 'www.test.com', sending unauth normal response

	Now we need to add some records to our database:

	If we now requery our database, <command>www.test.com</command> should be present:

  <Chapter id="pipebackend-dynamic-resolution">
    <title>Dynamic resolution using the PipeBackend</title>
    <para>
      Also included in the PDNS distribution is the PipeBackend. The PipeBackend is primarily meant for
      allowing rapid development of new backends without tight integration with PowerDNS. It allows
      end-users to write PDNS backends in any language. A perl sample is provided.

      The PipeBackend is also very well suited for dynamic resolution of queries. Example applications include
      DNS based loadbalancing, geo-direction, DNS based failover with low TTLs.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Pipe Backend also has a separate chapter in the backends appendix, see <xref linkend="pipebackend">.
    </para>
    <para>
      <note>
	<para>
	  The Pipe Backend currently does not function under FreeBSD 4.x and 5.x, probably due to unfavorable interactions between
	  its threading implementation and the fork system call.

    <sect1 id="pipe-and-bind"><title>Deploying the PipeBackend with the BindBackend</title>
      <para>
        Included with the PDNS distribution is the example.pl backend which has knowledge of the example.com zone, just like
        the BindBackend. To install both, add the following to your <filename>pdns.conf</filename>:
        <screen>
          launch=pipe,bind
          bind-example-zones
          pipe-command=location/of/backend.pl
        </screen>
        Please adjust the <command>pipe-command</command> statement to the location of the unpacked PDNS distribution. If your backend is slow,
	raise <command>pipe-timeout</command> from its default of 2000ms.

        Now launch PDNS in monitor mode, and perform some queries. Note the difference with the earlier experiment where only the 
        BindBackend was loaded. The PipeBackend is launched first and thus gets queried first.

        The sample backend.pl script knows about:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      webserver.example.com A records pointing to 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5, 1.2.3.6

  <Chapter id="monitoring">
    <title>Logging &amp; Monitoring PDNS performance</title>
    <para>
      In a production environment, you will want to be able to monitor PDNS performance. For this purpose, currently 
      two methods are available, the webserver and the init.d
<command>dump</command>, <command>show</command> and 
      <command>mrtg</command>, commands. Furthermore, PDNS can perform a configurable amount of operational logging. This chapter
	also explains how to configure syslog for best results.

    <sect1 id="webserver"><title>Webserver</title>
      <para>
	To launch the internal webserver, add a <command>webserver</command> statement to the pdns.conf. This 
	will instruct the PDNS daemon to start a webserver on localhost at port 8081, without password protection. 
	Only local users (on the same host) will be able to access the webserver by default.

	The webserver 	lists a lot of information about the PDNS process, including frequent queries, frequently failing queries, 
	lists of remote hosts sending queries, hosts sending corrupt queries etc. The webserver does not allow
	remote management of the daemon.

      <sect1 id="syslog"><title>Operational logging using syslog</title>
      <para>(<command>logging-facility</command> is available from 1.99.10 and onwards)</para>
      <para>
	This chapter assumes familiarity with syslog, the unix logging device. PDNS logs messages with different levels. The more urgent the 
	message, the lower the 'priority'. By default, PDNS will only log messages with an urgency of 3 or lower, but this can be changed
	using the <command>loglevel</command> setting in the configuration file. Setting it to 0 will eliminate all logging, 9 will log
	everything.
      </para>
      <para>
	By default, logging is performed under the 'DAEMON' facility which is shared with lots of other programs. If you regard nameserving
	as important, you may want to have it under a dedicated facility so PDNS can log to its own files, and not clutter generic files.
      </para>
      <para>
	For this purpose, syslog knows about 'local' facilities, numbered from LOCAL0 to LOCAL7. To move PDNS logging to LOCAL0, add 
	<command>logging-facility=0</command> to your configuration.
      </para>
      <para>
	Furthermore, you may want to have separate files for the differing prioties - preventing lower priority messages from obscuring 
	important ones.
      </para>
      <para>
	A sample syslog.conf might be:
	<programlisting>
local0.info                       -/var/log/pdns.info
local0.warn                       -/var/log/pdns.warn
local0.err                        /var/log/pdns.err
	</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	Where local0.err would store the really important messages. For performance and diskspace reasons, it is advised
	to audit your syslog.conf for statements also logging PDNS activities. Many syslog.confs have a '*.*' statement to
	/var/log/syslog, which you may want to remove.
      </para>
      <para>
	For performance reasons, be especially certain that no large amounts of synchronous logging take place. Under Linux, this 
	is indicated by filenames not starting with a '-' - indicating a synchronous log, which hurts performance.
      </para>

  <chapter id="security"><title>Security settings &amp; considerations</title>
    <sect1 id="settings"><title>Settings</title>
      <para>PDNS has several options to easily allow it to run more securely. Most notable are the <command>chroot</command>, 
	<command>setuid</command> and <command>setgid</command> options which can be specified.</para>

	<sect2><title>Running as a less privileged identity</title>
	<para>
	  By specifying <command>setuid</command> and <command>setgid</command>, PDNS changes to this identity shortly after
	  binding to the privileged DNS ports. These options are highly recommended. It is suggested that a separate identity
	  is created for PDNS as the user 'nobody' is in fact quite powerful on most systems.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Both these parameters can be specified either numerically or as real names.
	  You should set these parameters immediately if they are not set!
	</para>
	<sect2><title>Jailing the process in a chroot</title>
	<para>
	  The <command>chroot</command> option secures PDNS to its own directory so that even if it should become compromised and
	  under control of external influences, it will have a hard time affecting the rest of the system.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Even though this will hamper hackers a lot, chroot jails have been known to be broken. 
	</para>
	<para>
	  <warning>
	    <para>
	      When chrooting PDNS, take care that backends will be able to get to their files. Many databases need access to a UNIX 
	      domain socket which should live within the chroot. It is often possible to hardlink such a socket into the chroot dir.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      When running with master or slave support, be aware that many operating systems need access to specific libraries
	      (ofen <filename>/lib/libnss*</filename>) in order to support resolution of domain names! You can also hardlink these.
	    </para>
	  </warning>
	</para><para>
	  The default PDNS configuration is best chrooted to <filename>./</filename>, which boils down to the configured location
	  of the controlsocket. 
	</para><para>
	  This is achieved by adding the following to pdns.conf: <command>chroot=./</command>, and restarting PDNS.
	</para>
      </sect2>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="considerations"><title>Considerations</title>
      <para>
	In general, make sure that the PDNS process is unable to execute commands on your backend database. 
	Most database backends will only need SELECT privilege. Take care to not connect to your database as the 'root' 
	or 'sa' user, and configure the chosen user to have very slight privileges.
      </para>
      <para>
	Databases empathic-ally do not need to run on the same machine that runs PDNS! In fact, in benchmarks
	it has been discovered that having a separate database machine actually improves performance.
      </para>
      <para>
	Separation will enhance your database security highly. Recommended.
      </para>
      </sect1>
    </chapter>
    
  <chapter id="virtual"><title>Virtual hosting</title>
    <para>
      It may be advantageous to run multiple separate PDNS installations on a single host, for example to make sure
      that different customers cannot affect each others zones. PDNS fully supports running multiple instances on one host.
    </para>
    <para>
      To generate additional PDNS instances, copy the init.d script <filename>pdns</filename> to <filename>pdns-name</filename>, 
      where <filename>name</filename> is the name of your virtual configuration. Must not contain a - as this will confuse the 
      script.
    </para>
    <para>
      When you launch PDNS via this renamed script, it will seek configuration instructions not in <filename>pdns.conf</filename>
      but in <filename>pdns-name.conf</filename>, allowing for separate specification of parameters.
    </para>
    <para>
      Be aware however that the init.d <command>force-stop</command> will kill all PDNS instances!
    </para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter id="performance"><title>Performance related settings</title>
    <para>
      Different backends will have different characteristics - some will want to have more parallel
      instances than others. In general, if your backend is latency bound, like most relational databases are, 
      it pays to open more backends.
    </para>
    <para>
      This is done with the <command>distributor-threads</command> setting. Of special importance is the choice between 1
      or more backends. In case of only 1 thread, PDNS reverts to unthreaded operation which may be a lot faster, depending
      on your operating system and architecture.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another very important setting <command>cache-ttl</command>. PDNS caches entire packets it sends out so as to save the
      time to query backends to assemble all data. The default setting of 10 seconds may be low for high traffic sites, a value of
      60 seconds rarely leads to problems.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some PDNS operators set cache-ttl to many hours or even days, and use <command>pdns_control purge</command> to selectively
      or globally notify PDNS of changes made in the backend. Also look at the Query Cache described in this chapter. It may
      materially improve your performance.
    </para>
    <para>
      To determine if PDNS is unable to keep up with packets, determine the value of the <command>qsize-q</command> variable. 
      This represents the number of packets waiting for database attention. During normal operations the queue should be small. 
    </para>
    <para>
      If it is known that backends will not contain CNAME records, the <command>skip-cname</command> setting can be used to prevent 
      the normally mandatory CNAME lookup that is needed at least once for each DNS query. 
    </para>

    <para>
      Much the same holds for the <command>wildcards</command> setting. On by default, each non-existent query will lead to a number of additional
      wildcard queries. If it is known that the backends do not contain wildcard records, performance can be improved by adding <command>wildcards=no</command>
      to <filename>pdns.conf</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Logging truly kills performance as answering a question from the cache is an order of magnitude less work than logging a 
      line about it. Busy sites will prefer to turn <command>log-dns-details</command> and <command>log-failed-updates</command>
      off.
    </para>
    <sect1 id="packetcache"><title>Packet Cache</title>
      <para>
	PDNS by default uses the 'Packet Cache' to recognise identical questions and supply them with identical answers, without any further 
	processing. The default time to live is 10 seconds. It has been observed that the utility of the packet cache increases with the load on 
	your nameserver. 
      </para>
      <para>
	Not all backends may benefit from the packetcache. If your backend is memory based and does not lead to context switches, the packetcache
	may actually hurt performance. 
      </para>
      <para>
	The size of the packetcache can be observed with <command>/etc/init.d/pdns show packetcache-size</command>
      </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="querycache"><title>Query Cache</title>
      <para>
	Besides entire packets, PDNS can also cache individual backend queries. Each DNS query leads to a number of backend queries,
	the most obvious additional backend query is the check for a possible CNAME. So, when a query comes in for the 'A' record for
	'www.powerdns.com', PDNS must first check for a CNAME for 'www.powerdns.com'.
      </para>
      <para>
	The Query Cache caches these backend queries, many of which are quite repetitive. PDNS only caches queries with no answer,
	or with exactly one. In the future this may be expanded but this lightweight solution is very simple and therefore fast.
      </para>
      <para>
	Most gain is made from caching negative entries, ie, queries that have no answer. As these take little memory to store and
	are typically not a real problem in terms of speed-of-propagation, the default TTL for negative queries is a rather high 60 seconds.
      </para>
      <para>
	This only is a problem when first doing a query for a record, adding it, and immediately doing a query for that record again. It may
	then take up to 60 seconds to appear. Changes to existing records however do not fall under the negative query ttl (
	<command>negquery-cache-ttl</command>), but under the generic <command>query-ttl</command> which defaults to 20 seconds.
      </para>
      <para>
	The default values should work fine for many sites. When tuning, keep in mind that the Query Cache mostly saves database access 
	but that the Packet Cache also saves a lot of CPU because 0 internal processing is done when answering a question from the
	Packet Cache.
      </para>

	      to provide non-authoritative answers. See <xref linkend="recursion"> for more details.

  <chapter id="recursion"><title>Recursion</title>
    <para>(only available from 1.99.8 and onwards, recursing component available since 2.9.5)</para>
    <para>
      From 2.9.5 onwards, PowerDNS offers both authoritative nameserving capabilities and a recursive nameserver component. These two halves
      are normally separate but many users insist on combining both recursion and authoritative service on one IP address. This can be likened 
      to running Apache and Squid both on port 80.
    </para>
    <para>
      However, many sites want to do this anyhow and some with good reason. For example, a setup like this allows the creation of fake domains
      which only exist for local users. Such domains often don't end on ".com" or ".org" but on ".intern" or ".name-of-isp".
    </para>
    <para>
      PowerDNS can cooperate with either its own recursor or any other you have available to deliver recursive service on its port.
    </para>
    <para>
      By specifying the <command>recursor</command> option in the configuration file, questions requiring recursive treatment will be handed over
      to the IP address specified. An example configuration might be <command>recursor=130.161.180.1</command>, which designates 130.161.180.1 as
      the nameserver to handle recursive queries.
    </para>
    <para>
      As of 2.9.5, the recursing component of PowerDNS is a bit young and relatively untested but we hope people will want to use it anyhow. As an alternative,
      we highly advise the use of the DJBDNS dnscache (<ULINK URL="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dnscache.html" TYPE="alternate">http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dnscache.html</ULINK>).
    </para>
    <para>
      Take care not to point <command>recursor</command> to PDNS, which leads to a very tight packet loop!
    </para>
    <para>
      By specifying <command>allow-recursion</command>, recursion can be restricted to netmasks specified. The default is to allow
      recursion from everywhere. Example: <command>allow-recursion=192.168.0.0/24, 10.0.0.0/8, 1.2.3.4</command>.

	Questions carry a number of flags. One of these is called 'Recursion Desired'. If PDNS is configured to allow recursion, AND such a flag
	is seen, AND the IP address of the client is allowed to recurse via PDNS, then the packet may be handed to the recursing backend.
      </para>
      <para>
	If a Recursion Desired packet arrives and PDNS is configured to allow recursion, but not to the IP address of the client, resolution will proceed 
	as if the RD flag were unset and the answer will indicate that recursion was not available.
      </para>
      <para>
	It is also possible to use a resolver living on a different port. To do so, specify a recursor like this: 
	<command>recursor=130.161.180.1:5300</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
	If the backend does not answer a question within a large amount of time, this is logged as 'Recursive query for remote 10.96.0.2 with internal id 0 
	was not answered by backend within timeout, reusing id'. This may happen when using 'BIND' as a recursor as it is prone to drop queries which it can't 
	answer immediately.
      </para>
      <para>
	To make sure that the local authoritative database overrides recursive information, PowerDNS first tries to answer a question from its own database.
	If that succeeds, the answer packet is sent back immediately without involving the recursor in any way. This means that for questions for which there is no answer, PowerDNS will consult the recursor for an recursive query, even if PowerDNS is authoritative for a domain! This will only cause problems if you 'fake' domains which don't really exist.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you want to create such fake domains or override existing domains, please set the <command>allow-recursion-override</command> feature (available as of 2.9.14).
      </para>
      <para>
	Some packets, like those asking for MX records which are needed for SMTP transport of email, can be subject to 'additional processing'. This means
	that a recursing nameserver is obliged to try to add A records (IP addresses) for any of the mailservers mentioned in the packet, should it have 
	these addresses available.
      </para>
      <para>
	If PowerDNS encounters records needing such processing and finds that it does not have the data in its authoritative database, it will send 
	an opportunistic quick query to the recursing component to see if it perhaps has such data. This question is worded such that the recursing nameserver
	should return immediately such as not to block the authoritative nameserver.
      </para>
      <para>
	This marks a change from pre-2.9.5 behaviour where a packet was handed wholesale to the recursor in case it needed additional processing which could
	not proceed from the authoritative database.

    <sect1><title>Statistics</title>
      <para>
	Every half our or so, the recursor outputs a line with statistics. More infrastructure is planned so as to allow
	for Cricket or MRTG graphs. To force the output of statistics, send the process a SIGUSR1. A line of statistics looks 
	like this:
<screen>
Feb 10 14:16:03 stats: 125784 questions, 13971 cache entries, 309 negative entries, 84% cache hits, outpacket/query ratio 37%, 12% throttled
</screen>
	This means that there are 13791 different names cached, which each may have multiple records attached to them. There are 309 items
	in the negative cache, items of which it is known that don't exist and won't do so for the near future. 84% of incoming questions
	could be answered without any additional queries going out to the net.
      </para>
      <para>
	The outpacket/query ratio means that on average, 0.37 packets were needed to answer a question. Initially this ratio may be well over 100%
	as additional queries may be needed to actually recurse the DNS and figure out the addresses of nameservers.
      </para>

	Finally, 12% of queries were not performed because identical queries had gone out previously, saving load servers worldwide.

  <chapter id="replication"><title>Master/Slave operation &amp; replication</title>

    <para>
      PDNS offers full master and slave semantics for replicating domain information. Furthermore, PDNS can benefit from native
      database replication.
    </para>
    <sect1 id="native-replication"><title>Native replication</title>
      <para>
	Native replication is the default, unless other operation is specifically configured. Native replication basically means that PDNS will
	not send out DNS update notifications, nor will react to them. PDNS assumes that the backend is taking care of replication unaided.
      </para>
      <para>
	MySQL replication has proven to be very robust and well suited, even over transatlantic connections between badly peering ISPs. Other PDNS
	users employ Oracle replication which also works very well.
      </para>
      <para>
	To use native replication, configure your backend storage to do the replication and do not configure PDNS to do so.
      </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="slave"><title>Slave operation</title>
      <para>
	On launch, PDNS requests from all backends a list of domains which have not been checked recently for changes. This should happen every 
	'<command>refresh</command>' seconds, as specified in the SOA record. All domains that are unfresh are then checked for changes over at their
	master. If the <link linkend="soa-type">SOA</link> serial number there is higher, the domain is retrieved and inserted into the database. In 
	any case, after the check the domain is declared 'fresh', and will only be checked again after '<command>refresh</command>' seconds have passed.
      </para>
      <para>
	<warning>
	  <para>
	    Slave support is OFF by default, turn it on by adding <command>slave</command> to the configuration. The same 
	    holds for master operation. Both can be on simultaneously.
	  </para>
	</warning>
      </para>

      <para>
	PDNS also reacts to notifies by immediately checking if the zone has updated and if so, retransfering it.
      </para>
      <para>
	All backends which implement this feature must make sure that they can handle transactions so as to not leave the zone in a half updated state. 
	MySQL configured with either BerkeleyDB or InnoDB meets this requirement, as do PostgreSQL and Oracle. The Bindbackend implements transaction
	semantics by renaming files if and only if they have been retrieved completely and parsed correctly.
      </para>
      <para>
	Slave operation can also be programmed using several pdns_control commands, see <xref linkend="pdnscontrol">. The 'retrieve' command
	is especially useful as it triggers an immediate retrieval of the zone from the configured master.
      </para>
      <sect2 id=supermaster><title>Supermaster automatic provisioning of slaves</title>
	<para>
	  PDNS can recognize so called 'supermasters'. A supermaster is a host which is master for domains and for which we are to be a slave. When
	  a master (re)loads a domain, it sends out a notification to its slaves. Normally, such a notification is only accepted if PDNS already 
	  knows that it is a slave for a domain.
	</para>
	<para>
	  However, a notification from a supermaster carries more persuasion. When PDNS determines that a notification comes from a supermaster and it 
	  is bonafide, PDNS can provision the domain automatically, and configure itself as a slave for that zone.
	</para>
	<para>
	  To enable this feature, a backend needs to know about the IP address of the supermaster, and how PDNS will be listed in the set of
	  NS records remotely, and the 'account' name of your supermaster. There is no need to fill this out but it does help keep track of
	  where a domain comes from.
	</para>
      </sect2>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="master"><title>Master operation</title>
      <para>
	When operating as a master, PDNS sends out notifications of changes to slaves, which react to these notifications by querying PDNS to see
	if the zone changed, and transferring its contents if it has. Notifications are a way to promptly propagate zone changes to slaves, as 
	described in RFC 1996.
      </para>
      <para>
      <para>
	<warning>
	  <para>
	    Master support is OFF by default, turn it on by adding <command>master</command> to the configuration. The same 
	    holds for slave operation. Both can be on simultaneously.
	  </para>
	</warning>
      </para>

      <para>
	Left open by RFC 1996 is who is to be notified - which is harder to figure out than it sounds. All slaves for this domain must receive a notification
	but the nameserver only knows the names of the slaves - not the IP addresses, which is where the problem lies. The nameserver itself might
	be authoritative for the name of its secondary, but not have the data available.
      </para>
      <para>
	To resolve this issue, PDNS tries multiple tactics to figure out the IP addresses of the slaves, and notifies everybody. In contrived configurations
	this may lead to duplicate notifications being sent out, which shouldn't hurt.
      </para>
      <para>
	Some backends may be able to detect zone changes, others may chose to let the operator indicate which zones have changed and which haven't.
	Consult the documentation for your backend to see how it processes changes in zones.
      </para>
      <para>
	To help deal with slaves that may have missed notifications, or have failed to respond to them, several override commands are available via 
	the pdns_control tool (<xref linkend="pdnscontrol">):

  <chapter id="fancy-records"><title>Fancy records for seamless email and URL integration</title>

    <para>
      PDNS also supports so called 'fancy' records. A Fancy Record is actually not a DNS record, but it is translated into one. Currently,
      two fancy records are implemented, but not very useful without additional unreleased software. For completeness, they are listed here.
      The software will become available later on and is part of the Express and PowerMail suite of programs.
    </para>
    <para>
      These records imply extra database lookups which has a performance impact. Therefore fancy records are only queried for if they are enabled
      with the <command>fancy-records</command> command in <filename>pdns.conf</filename>.

	      </screen>
	      When PDNS encounters a request for an MX record for yourdomain.com it will, if fancy records are enabled, also check for the existence
	      of an MBOXFW record ending on '@yourdomain.com', in which case it will hand out a record containing the configured 
	      <command>smtpredirector</command>. This server should then also be able to access the PDNS database to figure out where mail to

	  <term><anchor id="soa-type">SOA</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The Start of Authority record is one of the most complex available. It specifies a lot about a domain: the name 
	      of the master nameserver ('the primary'), the hostmaster and a set of numbers indicating how the data in this domain
	      expires and how often it needs to be checked. Further more, it contains a serial number which should rise on each change
	      of the domain.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The stored format is:
	      <screen>
		primary hostmaster serial refresh retry expire default_ttl
	      </screen>
	      Besides the primary and the hostmaster, all fields are numerical. PDNS has a set of default values:
	      <table>
		<title>SOA fields</title>
		<tgroup cols=2>
		  <tbody>
		    <row>
		      <entry>primary</entry><entry><command>default-soa-name</command> configuration option</entry>

	      </table>
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The fields have complicated and sometimes controversial meanings. The 'serial' field is special. If left at 0, the default,
	      PDNS will perform an internal list of the domain to determine highest change_date field of all records within the zone, and use
	      that as the zone serial number. This means that the serial number is always raised when changes are made to the zone, as long
	      as the change_date field is being set.

	      SRV records can be used to encode the location and port of services on a domain name. When encoding, the priority field
	      is used to encode the priority. For example, '_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.conaxis.ch SRV     0 100 389 mars.conaxis.ch' would be

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A: Start out with stating what you think should be happening. Quite often, wrong expectations are the actual proble. 
	      Furthermore, which database backend you use, your operating system, which version of PowerDNS you use and where you 
	      got it from (RPM, .DEB, tar.gz). If you compiled it yourself, what were the ./configure parameters.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      In the Open Source community, not supplying vital details is interpreted as a lack of respect for those willing to take 
	      time to answer your questions!
	    </para>

      <para>
	In the course of compiling and using PowerDNS, many questions may arise. Here are some we've heard earlier or questions 
	we expect people may have. Please read this list before mailing us!
      </para>
      <para>
	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Q: I get this entry a lot of times in my log file: Authoritative empty NO ERROR to 1.2.3.4 for 'powerdns.nl' (AAAA)..</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		As the name implies, this is not an error. It tells you there are questions for a domain which exists in your database, but for
		which no record of the requested type exists. To get rid of this error, add <command>log-dns-details=off</command> to your
		configuration.
	      </para>

	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Q: Can I launch multiple backends simultaneously?</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: You can. This might for example be useful to keep an existing BIND configuration around but to store new zones in, say
		MySQL. The syntax to use is 'launch=bind,gmysql'.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Q: PowerDNS does not give authoritative answers, how come?</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: This is almost always not the case. An authoritative answer is recognized by the 'AA' bit being set. Many tools
		prominently print the number of Authority records included in an answer, leading users to conclude that the 
		absence or presence of these records indicates the authority of an answer. This is not the case.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		Verily, many misguided country code domain operators have fallen into this trap and demand authority records, even though
		these are fluff and quite often misleading. Invite such operators to look at section 6.2.1 of RFC 1034, which shows a correct
		authoritative answer without authority records. In fact, none of the non-deprecated authoritative answers shown have authority 
		records!
	      </para>
	      <para>
		Sorry for sounding like DJB on this, but we get so many misguided questions about authority..

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Q: Which backend should I use? There are so many!</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: If you have no external constraints, the Generic MySQL (gmysql) and Generic PostgreSQL (gpgsql) ones are probably the
		most used and complete. By all means do not use the non-generic MySQL backend, which is deprecated and only available for older
		installations.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		The Oracle backend also has happy users, we know of no deployments of the DB2 backend. The BIND backend is pretty capable
		too in fact, but many prefer a relational database.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Q: I try to launch the pgmysqlbackend and it can't find it!</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: You did not read the changelog, nor the README. The 'pgmysql' backend is no more and has been split
		into the gmysql and gpgsql backends, with the common code residing within PowerDNS itself.
	      </para>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Q: PowerDNS compiles under OpenBSD, but crashes immediately, now what?</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: Reasons behind this are somewhat unclear but we hear they go away if you use a more recent compiler. Let us know
		on <email>pdns-dev@mailman.powerdns.com</email>. See also 
		<ulink url="http://www.codeninja.nl/openbsd/powerdns/">here</ulink>.

	    <term>Q: I'm trying to build from CVS but I get lots of weird errors!</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: Read the 'HACKING' file, it lists the build requirements (mostly autoconf, automake, libtool). In many cases, 
		it may be easier to build from the source distribution though.

	    <term>Q: I'm on Solaris 7 and AAAA records do not work</term>
	    <listitem>

	    <term>Q: When compiling I get errors about 'sstream' and 'ostringstream', or BITSPERCHAR</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: Your gcc is too old. Versions 2.95.2 and older are not supported. Many distributions have improved gcc 2.95.2 
		with an ostringstream implementation, in which case their 2.95.2 is also supported. We like gcc 3.2.1 best.

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Q: Ok, I've installed gcc 3.2.1 but now the gpgsql backend won't link</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: Sadly, the gcc C++ on-disk object format has changed a few times since the 2.95 days. This means that
		gcc 3.2.1 cannot link against libpq++.so compiled with 2.95. The trick is to recompile PostgreSQL with 3.2.1
		too and have it install in a separate location. Then reconfigure the pdns compile to look there, with
		<command>./configure --with-pgsql-lib=/opt/postgresql-with-3.2.1/lib</command>
	      </para>

	    <term>Q: I've installed PostgreSQL 7.3 but it has no libpq++.so</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: As of 7.3, libpq++ has been split out of the main PostgreSQL distribution. See <ulink url="http://gborg.postgresql.org/">here</ulink>.
		It would in fact be a great idea to move the gpgsql backend to the C interface instead of the C++ one. On Debian 'Sid', libpq++.so
		hides in the libpqpp-dev package.

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Q: PowerDNS crashes when I install the pdns-static .deb on Debian SID</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: Indeed. Install the .debs that come with Debian or recompile PowerDNS yourself. If not using MySQL, the crashes
		will go away if you remove setuid and setgid statements from the configuration.
	      </para>

	    <term>Q: Why don't my slaves act on notifications and transfer my updated zone?</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: Raise the serial number of your zone. In most backends, this is the first digit of the SOA contents field. If this number
		is lower to equal to that on a slave, it will not consider your zone updated.
	      </para>

	    <term>Q: Master or Slave support is not working, PDNS is not picking up changes</term>

	      <para>
		A: The Master/Slave apparatus is off by default. Turn it on by adding a <command>slave</command> and/or
		<command>master</command> statement to the configuration file. Also, check that the configured backend is master or slave capable.

	    <term>Q: I compiled PowerDNS myself and I see weird problems, especially on SMP</term>

	      <para>
		A: There are known issues between gcc &lt;3.2 and PowerDNS on Linux SMP systems. The exact cause is not known but
		moving to our precompiled version always fixes the problems. If you compile yourself, use a recent gcc!

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: Please don't ignore what PowerDNS says to you. Furthermore, read <xref linkend="all-settings"> about the <command>local-address</command>
		setting, and use it to specify which IP addresses PowerDNS should listen on.
	      </para>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Q: Can I use a MySQL database with the Windows version of PowerDNS?</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: You can. MySQL support is supplied through the ODBC backend, which is compiled into the main binary.
		So if you want to use MySQL you can change the pdns.conf file, which is located in the PowerDNS for Windows directory, to use the 
		correct ODBC data sources.

		If you don't know how to use ODBC with MySQL:
		<itemizedlist>
		  <listitem><para>
		      Download MyODBC from <ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</ulink>
		    </para></listitem>
		  <listitem><para>
		      Install the MySQL ODBC driver.
		    </para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		Then you can follow the instructions located in <xref linkend="windows">.
		But instead of selecting the Microsoft Access Driver you select the MySQL ODBC Driver and configure it to use your MySQL database.
    
		<note><para>For other databases for which an ODBC driver is available, the procedure is the same as this example.</para></note>

    <sect1 id="pdns-devel-faq"><title>Backend developer HOWTO</title>
      <para>
	Writing backends without access to the full PDNS source means that you need to write code that can be loaded by PDNS at runtime. 
	This in turn means that you need to use the same compiler that we do. For linux, this is currently GCC 3.0.4, although any 3.0.x 
	compiler is probably fine. In tests, even 3.1 works.
      </para>
      <para>
	For FreeBSD we use GCC 2.95.2.
      </para>
      <para>
	Furthermore, your pdns_server executable must be dynamically linked. The default .rpm PDNS contains a static binary so you need to retrieve the
	dynamic rpm or the dynamic tar.gz or the Debian unstable ('Woody') deb. FreeBSD dynamic releases are forthcoming.
      </para>
      <variablelist>

	  <term>Q: Will PDNS drivers work with other PDNS versions than they were compiled for?</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A: 'Probably'. We make no guarantees. Efforts have been made to keep the interface between the backend and PDNS as thin
	      as possible. For example, a backend compiled with the 1.99.11 backend development kit works with 1.99.10. But don't count on it.
	      We will notify when we think an incompatible API change has occured but you are best off recompiling your driver for each
	      new PDNS release.

	  <term>Q: What is in that DNSPacket * pointer passed to lookup!</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A: For reasons outlined above, you should treat that pointer as opaque and only access it via the <function>getRemote()</function> 
	      functions made available and documented above. The DNSPacket class changes a lot and this level of indirection allows for greater
	      changes to be made without changing the API to the backend coder.

	      <para>
		A: In the current economic climate and also the way the Internet is built up right now, selling software is very hard. Most  potential 
		customers had never before bought a piece of software for their UNIX internet setup. Even though we know (from the recent survey) that
		nameserver operators love PowerDNS, their suggested price for it is in the $100 range.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		For us, it makes far more sense to open source PowerDNS than to ask $100 for it. It is expected that open sourcing PowerDNS will lead
		to far higher adoption rates. We hope that PowerDNS will soon be included in major Linux and UNIX distributions.

	The PipeBackend allows for easy dynamic resolution based on a 'Coprocess' which can be written in any
	programming language that can read a question on standard input and answer on standard output. 
      </para>
    <para>
      <note>
	<para>
	  The Pipe Backend currently does not function under FreeBSD 4.x and 5.x, probably due to unfavorable interactions between
	  its threading implementation and the fork system call.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Interestingly, the Linux PowerDNS binary running under the Linuxulator on FreeBSD does work.

      <title>Handshake</title>
      <para>
        PowerDNS sends out 'HELO\t1', indicating that it wants to speak the
        protocol as defined in this document, version 1.
        
        A PowerDNS CoProcess must then send out a banner, prefixed by 'OK\t', 
        indicating it launched successfully. If it does not support the indicated
        version, it should respond with FAIL, but not exit. Suggested behaviour is
        to try and read a further line, and wait to be terminated.
      </para></sect3>
    <sect3><title>Questions</title>
      <para>
        Questions come in three forms and are prefixed by a tag indicating the kind:

	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>
The question format:
<screen>
type	qname		qclass	qtype	id	ip-address
</screen>

Fields are tab separated, and terminated with a single \n. 

Type is the tag above, qname is the domain the question is about. qclass is
always 'IN' currently, denoting an INternet question. qtype is the kind of
information desired, the record type, like A, CNAME or AAAA. id can be
specified to help your backend find an answer if the id is already known
from an earlier query. You can ignore it.

ip-address is the ip-address of the nameserver asking the question.
      </para></sect3>
    <sect3><title>Answers</title>
      <para>

        Each answer starts with a tag, possibly followed by a TAB and more data.
	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>DATA</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                Indicating a successful line of DATA
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>END</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                Indicating the end of an answer - no further data
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>FAIL</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                Indicating a lookup failure. Also serves as 'END'. No further data.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>LOG</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                For specifying things that should be logged. Can only be sent after
                a query and before an END line. After the tab, the message to be
                logged
                
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>


        So letting it be known that there is no data consists if sending 'END'
        without anything else.


The answer format:
<screen>
DATA	qname		qclass	qtype	ttl	id	content	
</screen>

'content' is as specified in <xref linkend="types">.

A sample dialogue may look like this:
<screen>
Q	www.ds9a.nl	IN	CNAME	-1	213.244.168.210
DATA	www.ds9a.nl	IN	CNAME	3600	1 ws1.ds9a.nl
Q	ws1.ds9a.nl	IN	CNAME	-1	213.244.168.210
END
Q	wd1.ds9a.nl	IN	A	-1	213.244.168.210
DATA	ws1.ds9a.nl	IN	A	3600	1	1.2.3.4
DATA	ws1.ds9a.nl	IN	A	3600	1	1.2.3.5
DATA	ws1.ds9a.nl	IN	A	3600	1	1.2.3.6
END
</screen>

	  This would correspond to a remote webserver 213.244.168.210 wanting to
resolve the IP address of www.ds9a.nl, and PowerDNS traversing the CNAMEs to
find the IP addresses of ws1.ds9a.nl

Another dialogue might be:
<screen>
Q	ds9a.nl		IN	SOA	-1	213.244.168.210
DATA	ds9a.nl		IN	SOA	86400	1 ahu.ds9a.nl ...
END
AXFR	1
DATA	ds9a.nl		IN	SOA	86400	1 ahu.ds9a.nl ...
DATA	ds9a.nl		IN	NS	86400	1 ns1.ds9a.nl
DATA	ds9a.nl		IN	NS	86400	1 ns2.ds9a.nl
DATA	ns1.ds9a.nl	IN	A	86400	1 213.244.168.210
DATA	ns2.ds9a.nl	IN	A	86400	1 63.123.33.135
.
.
END
</screen>

This is a typical zone transfer.

        The MySQL Backend as present in PDNS is fixed - it requires a certain database schema to function. This schema corresponds to this create statement:
        
        <screen>
          CREATE TABLE records (
	  id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	  domain_id int(11) NOT NULL,
	  name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	  type varchar(6) NOT NULL,
	  content varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	  ttl int(11) NOT NULL,
	  prio int(11) default NULL,
	  change_date int(11) default NULL,
	  PRIMARY KEY (id),
	  KEY name_index(name),
	  KEY nametype_index(name,type),
	  KEY domainid_index(domain_id)
	  );
        </screen>
        
        Every domain should have a unique domain_id, which should remain identical for all records in a domain. Records with a domain_id that
	differs from that in the domain SOA record will not appear in a zone transfer.

      </para>
      <para>
	The change_date may optionally
        be updated to the time_t (the number of seconds since midnight UTC at the start of 1970), and is in that case used to auto calculate the 
        SOA serial number in case that is unspecified.

	PostgreSQL and MySQL backend with easily configurable SQL statements, allowing you to graft PDNS on any PostgreSQL or MySQL database of your choosing.

	The template queries are expanded using the C function 'snprintf' which implies that substitutions are performed on the basis of %-place holders. 
	To place a a % in a query which will not be substituted, use %%. Make sure to fill out the search key, often called 'name' in lower case!

      <sect2><title>Native operation</title>
	<para>
	  For native operation, either drop the FOREIGN KEY on the domain_id field, or (recommended), make sure
	  the <command>domains</command> table is filled properly. To add a domain, issue the following:
	  <programlisting>
	    insert into domains (name,type) values ('powerdns.com','NATIVE');
	  </programlisting>
	  The records table can now be filled by with the domain_id set to the id of the domains table row just inserted.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2><title>Slave operation</title>
	<para>
	  The PostgreSQL backend is fully slave capable. To become a slave of the 'powerdns.com' domain, execute this:
	  <programlisting>
	    insert into domains (name,master,type) values ('powerdns.com','213.244.168.217','SLAVE');
	  </programlisting>
	  And wait a while for PDNS to pick up the addition - which happens within one minute. There is no need to inform PDNS that a new domain
	  was added.
	  Typical output is:
	  <programlisting>
	    Apr 09 13:34:29 All slave domains are fresh
	    Apr 09 13:35:29 1 slave domain needs checking
	    Apr 09 13:35:29 Domain powerdns.com is stale, master serial 1, our serial 0
	    Apr 09 13:35:30 [gPgSQLBackend] Connected to database
	    Apr 09 13:35:30 AXFR started for 'powerdns.com'
	    Apr 09 13:35:30 AXFR done for 'powerdns.com'
	    Apr 09 13:35:30 [gPgSQLBackend] Closing connection
	  </programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	  From now on, PDNS is authoritative for the 'powerdns.com' zone and will respond accordingly for queries within that zone. 
	</para>
	<para>
	  Periodically, PDNS schedules checks to see if domains are still fresh. The default <command>slave-cycle-interval</command> is 60 seconds, large installations may need to raise this value. Once a domain has been checked, it will not be checked before its SOA refresh timer has expired. Domains whose status is unknown get checked every 60 seconds by default.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2><title>Superslave operation</title>
	<para>
	  To configure a supermaster with IP address 10.0.0.11 which lists this installation as 'autoslave.powerdns.com', issue the following:
	  <programlisting>
	    insert into supermasters ('10.0.0.11','autoslave.powerdns.com','internal');
	  </programlisting>
	  From now on, valid notifies from 10.0.0.11 that list a NS record containing 'autoslave.powerdns.com' will lead to the
	  provisioning of a slave domain under the account 'internal'. See <xref linkend="supermaster"> for details.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2><title>Master operation</title>
	<para>
	  The PostgreSQL backend is fully master capable with automatic discovery of serial changes. Raising the serial number of a domain
	  suffices to trigger PDNS to send out notifications. To configure a domain for master operation instead of the default native replication,
	  issue:
	  <programlisting>
	    insert into domains (name,type) values ('powerdns.com','MASTER');
	  </programlisting>
	  Make sure that the assigned id in the domains table matches the domain_id field in the records table!

        This backend retrieves all data from a SQLite database, which is a RDBMS that's embedded into the application itself, so you won't need to be running a seperate server process.
        It also reduces overhead, and simplifies installation.
        At <ulink url="http://www.sqlite.org">http://www.sqlite.org</ulink> you can find more information about SQLite.
      </para>
      <para>
        As this is a generic backend, built on top of the gSql framework, you can specify all queries as documented in <link linkend="generic-mypgsql-backends">Generic MySQL and PgSQL backends</link>.

        <title>Compiling the SQLite backend</title>
        <para>
          Before you can begin compiling PowerDNS with the SQLite backend you need to have the SQLite utility and library installed on your system.
          You can download these from <ulink url="http://www.sqlite.org/download.html">http://www.sqlite.org/download.html</ulink>, or you can use packages (if your distribution provides those).
        </para>
        <para>
          When you've installed the library you can use: <command>./configure --with-modules="gsqlite"</command> to configure PowerDNS to use the SQLite backend.
          Compilation can then proceed as usual.
        </para>

        <title>Setting up the database</title>
	      <para>
	        Before you can use this backend you first have to set it up and fill it with data.	        
	        The default setup conforms to the following schema:
	        
	        <programlisting>
            create table domains (

	      </para>
      	<para>
	        After you have created the database you probably want to fill it with data. 
	        If you have a BIND zonefile it's as easy as: <command>zone2sql --zone=myzonefile --gmysql | sqlite powerdns.sqlite</command>, but
	        you can also use AXFR (or insert data manually if you have too much time ;)).

	The BindBackend started life as a demonstration of the versatility of PDNS but quickly gained in importance when there appeared to be demand
	for a Bind 'workalike'.
      </para>
      <para>
	The BindBackend parses a Bind-style named.conf and extracts information about zones from it. It makes no attempt to honour other configuration flags,
	which you should configure (when available) using the PDNS native configuration.

	<para>
	  On launch, the BindBackend first parses the named.conf to determine which zones need to be loaded. These will then be parsed
	  and made available for serving, as they are parsed. So a named.conf with 100.000 zones may take 20 seconds to load, but after 10 seconds, 
	  50.000 zones will already be available. While a domain is being loaded, it is not yet available, to prevent incomplete answers.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Reloading is currently done only when a request for a zone comes in, and then only after <command>bind-check-interval</command> seconds have passed
	  after the last check. If a change occurred, access to the zone is disabled, the file is reloaded, access is restored, and the question is answered.
	  For regular zones, reloading is fast enough to answer the question which lead to the reload within the DNS timeout.

	  The BindBackend does not benefit from the packet cache as it is fast enough on its own. Furthermore, on most systems, there will
	  be no benefit in using multiple CPUs for the packetcache, so a noticeable speedup can be attained by specifying

	  <para>
	    Works as expected. At startup, no notification storm is performed as this is generally not useful. Perhaps in the future the Bind Backend
	    will attempt to store zone metadata in the zone, allowing it to determine if a zone has changed its serial since the last time
	    notifications were sent out.

	    Changes which are discovered when reloading zones do lead to notifications however.

	<sect3><title>Slave</title>
	  <para>
	    Also works as expected. The Bind backend expects to be able to write to a directory where a slave domain lives. The incoming zone is stored
	    as 'zonename.RANDOM' and atomically renamed if it is retrieved successfully, and parsed only then.

      PDNS is normally launched by the init.d script but is actually a binary called <filename>pdns_server</filename>. This 
      file is started by the <command>start</command> and <command>monitor</command> commands to the init.d script. Other commands
      are implemented using the controlsocket.
    </para>
    <sect1 id="controlsocket"><title>Controlsocket</title>
      <para>
        The controlsocket is the means to contact a running PDNS daemon, or as we now know, a running <filename>pdns_server</filename>.
        Over this sockets, instructions can be sent using the <filename>pdns_control</filename> program. Like the <filename>pdns_server</filename>,
        this program is normally accessed via the init.d script.
      </para>
      <sect2 id="pdnscontrol"><title>pdns_control</title>

	<para>
	  To communicate with PDNS over the controlsocket, the <command>pdns_control</command> command is used. The init.d script also calls 
	  pdns_control. The syntax is simple: <command>pdns_control command arguments</command>. Currently this is most useful for telling backends
	  to rediscover domains or to force the transmission of notifications. See <xref linkend="master">.

    <sect1 id="guardian"><title>Guardian</title>
      <para>
        When launched by the init.d script, <filename>pdns_server</filename> wraps itself inside a 'guardian'. This guardian monitors the
        performance of the inner <filename>pdns_server</filename> instance which shows up in the process list of your OS as 
        <filename>pdns_server-instance</filename>. 

        It is also this guardian that <filename>pdns_control</filename> talks to. A <command>STOP</command> is interpreted by the guardian, 
        which causes the guardian to sever the connection to the inner process and terminate it, after which it terminates itself.

        The init.d script <command>DUMP</command> and <command>SHOW</command> commands need to access the inner process, because
        the guardian itself does not run a nameserver. For this purpose, the guardian passes controlsocket requests to the control console of the
        inner process. This is the same console as seen with init.d <command>MONITOR</command>.

    <sect1 id="dns-to-query"><title>How PDNS translates DNS queries into backend queries</title>
      <para>
	A DNS query is not a straightforward lookup. Many DNS queries need to check the backend for additional data, for example to
	determine of an unfound record should lead to an NXDOMAIN ('we know about this domain, but that record does not exist') or an 
	unauthoritative response.
      </para>
      <para>
	Simplified, without CNAME processing and wildcards, the algorithm is like this:
      </para>
      <para>
	When a query for a <command>qname</command>/<command>qtype</command> tuple comes in, it is requested directly from the backend. 
	If present, PDNS adds the contents of the reply to the list of records to return. A question tuple may generate multiple answer 
	records.
      </para>
      <para>
	Each of these records is now investigated to see if it needs 'additional processing'. This holds for example for MX records which may
	point to hosts for which the PDNS backends also contain data. This involves further lookups for A or AAAA records.
      </para>
      <para>
	After all additional processing has been performed, PDNS sieves out all double records which may well have appeared. The resulting set of 
	records is added to the answer packet, and sent out.
      </para>
      <para>
	A zone transfer works by looking up the <command>domain_id</command> of the SOA record of the name and then listing all records of that 
	<command>domain_id</command>. This is why all records in a domain need to have the same domain_id.
      </para>
      <para>
	When a query comes in for an unknown domain, PDNS starts looking for SOA records of all subdomains of the qname, so 
	no.such.powerdns.com turns into a SOA query for no.such.powerdns.com, such.powerdns.com, powerdns.com, com, ''. When a SOA is found,
	that zone is consulted for relevant NS instructions which lead to a referral. If nothing is found within the zone, an authoritative 
	NXDOMAIN is sent out.
      </para>
      <para>
	If no SOA was found, an unauthoritative no-error is returned.
      </para>
      <para>
	In reality, each query for a question tuple first involves checking for a CNAME, unless that resolution has been disabled with the
	<command>skip-cname</command> option.
      </para>
      <para>
	PDNS breaks strict RFC compatability by not always checking for the presence of a SOA record first. This is unlikely to lead to 
	problems though.

  <appendix id="backend-writers-guide"><title>Backend writers' guide</title>
    <para>
      PDNS backends are implemented via a simple yet powerful C++ interface. If your needs are not met by the PipeBackend, you 
      may want to write your own. Doing so requires a copy of the PowerDNS Open Source Backend Development kit which can be found on <ulink 
	url="http://downloads.powerdns.com/releases/dev">http://downloads.powerdns.com/releases/dev</ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
      A backend contains zero DNS logic. It need not look for CNAMES, it need not return NS records unless explicitly asked for, etcetera.
      All DNS logic is contained within PDNS itself - backends should simply return records matching the description asked for. 
    </para>
    <para> 
      <warning><para>
      However, please note that your backend can get queries in aNy CAsE! If your database is case sensitive, like most are (with the notable
      exception of MySQL), you must make sure that you do find answers which differ only in case.
	</para></warning>
    </para>
    <sect1 id="simple-backends"><title>Simple read-only native backends</title>
      <para>
	Implementing a backend consists of inheriting from the DNSBackend class. For read-only backends, which do not support slave operation,
	only the following methods are relevant:
	
	<programlisting>
	class DNSBackend
	{
	public:

	virtual bool lookup(const QType &amp;qtype, const string &amp;qdomain, DNSPacket *pkt_p=0, int zoneId=-1)=0; 
	virtual bool list(int domain_id)=0; 
	virtual bool get(DNSResourceRecord &amp;r)=0;
	virtual bool getSOA(const string &amp;name, SOAData &amp;soadata);
	};
	</programlisting>
      
	Note that the first three methods must be implemented. <function>getSOA()</function> has a useful default implementation.
      </para>
      <para>
	The semantics are simple. Each instance of your class only handles one (1) query at a time. There is no need for locking as PDNS guarantees
	that your backend will never be called reentrantly. 
      </para>
      <para>
	Some examples, a more formal specification is down below. A normal lookup starts like this:
	
	<programlisting>
        YourBackend yb;
	yb.lookup(QType::CNAME,"www.powerdns.com");
	</programlisting>
      
	Your class should now do everything to start this query. Perform as much preparation as possible - handling errors at this stage is better for PDNS 
	than doing so later on. A real error should be reported by throwing an exception. 
      </para>
      <para>
	PDNS will then call the <function>get()</function> method to get <command>DNSResourceRecord</command>s back. The following code illustrates
	a typical query:
	
      <programlisting>
	yb.lookup(QType::CNAME,"www.powerdns.com");

	DNSResourceRecord rr;
	while(yb.get(rr))
   	  cout&lt;&lt;"Found cname pointing to '"+rr.content+"'"&lt;&lt;endl;
	}
	</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	Each zone starts with a Start of Authority (SOA) record. This record is special so many backends will choose to implement it
	specially. The default <function>getSOA()</function> method performs a regular lookup on your backend to figure out the SOA, 
	so if you have no special treatment for SOA records, where is no need to implement your own <function>getSOA()</function>.
      </para>
      <para>
	Besides direct queries, PDNS also needs to be able to list a zone, to do zone transfers for example. Each zone has an id which should be
	unique within the backend. To list all records belonging to a zone id, the <function>list()</function> method is used. Conveniently,
	the domain_id is also available in the <command>SOAData</command> structure.
      </para>
      <para>
	The following lists the contents of a zone called "powerdns.com".
      
	<programlisting>
	SOAData sd;
	if(!yb.getSOA("powerdns.com",sd))  // are we authoritative over powerdns.com?
	  return RCode::NotAuth;           // no

	yb.list(sd.domain_id); 
	while(yb.get(rr))
   	  cout&lt;&lt;rr.qname&lt;&lt;"\t IN "&lt;&lt;rr.qtype.getName()&lt;&lt;"\t"&lt;&lt;rr.content&lt;&lt;endl;
	</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	Please note that when so called 'fancy records' (see <xref linkend="fancy-records">) are enabled, a backend can receive
	wildcard lookups. These have a % as the first character of the qdomain in lookup. 
      </para>
      <sect2><title>A sample minimal backend</title>

        This simple backend can be used as an 'overlay'. In other words, it only knows about a single record, another loaded backend would have
        to know about the SOA and NS records and such. But nothing prevents us from loading it without another backend.
      </para>
      <para>
        The first part of the code contains the actual logic and should be pretty straightforward. The second part is a boilerplate
        'factory' class which PDNS calls to create randombackend instances. Note that a 'suffix' parameter is passed. Real life backends
        also declare parameters for the configuration file; these get the 'suffix' appended to them. Note that the "random" in the 
        constructor denotes the name by which the backend will be known.
      </para>
      <para>
        The third part registers the RandomFactory with PDNS. This is a simple C++ trick which makes sure that this function
        is called on execution of the binary or when loading the dynamic module.
      </para>
	<para>
	  Please note that a RandomBackend is actually in most PDNS releases. By default it lives on random.example.com, but you can change
	  that by setting <command>random-hostname</command>.

		This function is used to initiate a straight lookup for a record of name 'qdomain' and type 'qtype'.

    <sect1 id="rw-backends"><title>Read/write slave-capable backends</title>
      <para>
	The backends above are 'natively capable' in that they contain all data relevant for a domain and do not pull in data from other nameservers.
	To enable storage of information, a backend must be able to do more.
      </para>
      <para>
	Before diving into the details of the implementation some theory is in order. Slave domains are pulled from the master. PDNS needs to 
	know for which domains it is to be a slave, and for each slave domain, what the IP address of the master is.
      </para>
      <para>
	A slave zone is pulled from a master, after which it is 'fresh', but this is only temporary. In the SOA record of a zone there is a field
	which specifies the 'refresh' interval. After that interval has elapsed, the slave nameserver needs to check at the master ff the serial
	number there is higher than what is stored in the backend locally.
      </para>
      <para>
	If this is the case, PDNS dubs the domain 'stale', and schedules a transfer of data from the remote. This transfer remains scheduled
	until the serial numbers remote and locally are identical again.
      </para>
      <para>
	This theory is implemented by the <function>getUnfreshSlaveInfos</function> method, which is called on all backends periodically. 
	This method fills a vector of <command>SlaveDomain</command>s with domains that are unfresh and possibly stale. 
      </para>
      <para>
	PDNS then retrieves the SOA of those domains remotely and locally and creates a list of stale domains. For each of these domains, PDNS
	starts a zonetransfer to resynchronise. Because zone transfers can fail, it is important that the interface to the backend allows
	for transaction semantics because a zone might otherwise be left in a halfway updated situation.
      </para>
      <para>
	The following excerpt from the DNSBackend shows the relevant functions:

      <para>
	These functions all have a default implementation that returns false - which explains that these methods can be omitted in simple backends.

	out correctly - it is used to determine which backend will house this zone.

      <sect2><title>Supermaster/Superslave capability</title>
        <para>
          A backend that wants to act as a 'superslave' for a master should implement the following method:
          <programlisting>
            class DNSBackend 
            {
               virtual bool superMasterBackend(const string &amp;ip, const string &amp;domain, const vector&lt;DNSResourceRecord&gt;&amp;nsset, string *account, DNSBackend **db)
            };
          </programlisting>
          This function gets called with the IP address of the potential supermaster, the domain it is sending a notification for and the set of NS records
          for this domain at that IP address. 
        </para>
        <para>
          Using the supplied data, the backend needs to determine if this is a bonafide 'supernotification' which should be honoured. If it decides that it
          should, the supplied pointer to 'account' needs to be filled with the configured name of the supermaster (if accounting is desired), and the 
          db needs to be filled with a pointer to your backend.
        </para>
        <para>

      </para>
      <para>
        In order to do so, PDNS calls the <function>getUpdatedMasters()</function> method. Like the <function>getUnfreshSlaveInfos()</function>
        function mentioned above, this should add changed domain names to the vector passed.
      </para>

  <appendix id="license"><title>PowerDNS license (GNU General Public License version 2)</title>
    <para>
      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    </para>
    <para>

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</para><para>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
</para><para>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
</para><para>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
</para><para>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</para><para>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
</para><para>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

</para><para>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</para><para>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
</para><para>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</para><para>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
</para><para>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
</para><para>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,
</para><para>

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</para><para>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
</para><para>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</para><para>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
</para><para>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
</para><para>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
</para><para>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

</para><para>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</para><para>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
</para><para>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
</para><para>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
</para><para>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
</para><para>
			    NO WARRANTY
</para><para>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

</para><para>
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
