/** \page MTasker
    Simple system for implementing cooperative multitasking of functions, with 
    support for waiting on events which can return values.

    \section copyright Copyright and License
    MTasker is (c) 2002 by bert hubert. It is licensed to you under the terms of the GPL version 2.

    \section overview High level overview
    MTasker is designed to support very simple cooperative multitasking to facilitate writing 
    code that would ordinarily require a statemachine, for which the author does not consider 
    himself smart enough.

    This class does not perform any magic it only makes calls to makecontext() and swapcontext(). 
    Getting the details right however is complicated and MTasker does that for you.

    If preemptive multitasking or more advanced concepts such as semaphores, locks or mutexes
    are required, the use of POSIX threads is advised.

    MTasker is designed to offer the performance of statemachines while maintaining simple thread semantics. It is not
    a replacement for a full threading system.

    \section compatability Compatability
    MTasker is only guaranteed to work on Linux with glibc 2.2.5 and higher. It does not work on FreeBSD and notably,
    not on Red Hat 6.0. It may work on Solaris, please test.

    \section concepts Concepts

    There are two important concepts, the 'kernel' and the 'thread'. Each thread starts out as a function,
    which is passed to MTasker::makeThread(), together with a possible argument.

    This function is now free to do whatever it wants, but realise that MTasker implements cooperative
    multitasking, which means that the coder has the responsiblilty of not taking the CPU overly long.
    Other threads can only get the CPU if MTasker::yield() is called or if a thread sleeps to wait for an event, 
    using the MTasker::waitEvent() method.

    \section kernel The Kernel
    The Kernel consists of functions that do housekeeping, but also of code that the client coder 
    can call to report events. A minimal kernel loop looks like this:
    \code
    for(;;) {
       MT.schedule();
       if(MT.noProcesses())  // exit if no processes are left
          break;
    }
    \endcode

    The kernel typically starts from the main() function of your program. New threads are also
    created from the kernel. This can also happen before entering the main loop. To start a thread,
    the method MTasker::makeThread is provided.

    \section events Events
    By default, Events are recognized by an int and their value is also an int.
    This can be overriden by specifying the EventKey and EventVal template parameters.
    
    An event can be a keypress, but also a UDP packet, or a bit of data from a TCP socket. The
    sample code provided works with keypresses, but that is just a not very useful example.

    A thread can also wait for an event only for a limited time, and receive a timeout of that 
    event did not occur within the specified timeframe.

    \section example A simple menu system
    \code
MTasker<> MT;

void menuHandler(void *p)
{
  int num=(int)p;
  cout<<"Key handler for key "<<num<<" launched"<<endl;
 
  MT.waitEvent(num);
  cout<<"Key "<<num<<" was pressed!"<<endl;
}


int main()
{
  char line[10];

  for(int i=0;i<10;++i) 
    MT.makeThread(menuHandler,(void *)i);
  
  for(;;) {
    while(MT.schedule()); // do everything we can do
    if(MT.noProcesses())  // exit if no processes are left
      break;

    if(!fgets(line,sizeof(line),stdin))
      break;
    
    MT.sendEvent(*line-'0');
  }
}
\endcode

\section example2 Canonical multitasking example
This implements the canonical multitasking example, alternately printing an 'A' and a 'B'. The Linux kernel
  started this way too.
\code
void printer(void *p)
{
  char c=(char)p;
  for(;;) {
    cout<<c<<endl;
    MT.yield();
  }

}

int main()
{
  MT.makeThread(printer,(void*)'a');
  MT.makeThread(printer,(void*)'b');

  for(;;) {
    while(MT.schedule()); // do everything we can do
    if(MT.noProcesses())  // exit if no processes are left
      break;
  }
}
\endcode

//! puts a thread to sleep waiting until a specified event arrives
/** Threads can call waitEvent to register that they are waiting on an event with a certain key.
    If so desidered, the event can carry data which is returned in val in case that is non-zero.
    
    Furthermore, a timeout can be specified in seconds.
    
    Only one thread can be waiting on a key, results of trying to have more threads
    waiting on the same key are undefined.
    
    \param key Event key to wait for. Needs to match up to a key reported to sendEvent
    \param val If non-zero, the value of the event will be stored in *val
    \param timeout If non-zero, number of seconds to wait for an event.
    
    \return returns -1 in case of error, 0 in case of timeout, 1 in case of an answer
