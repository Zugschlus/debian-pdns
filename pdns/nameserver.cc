/** \mainpage 
    PowerDNS is a very versatile nameserver that can answer questions from different backends. To implement your
    own backend, see the documentation for the DNSBackend class.

    \section copyright Copyright and License
    PowerDNS is (C) 2005 PowerDNS.COM BV. It is distributed according to the terms of the General Public License version 2.

    \section overview High level overview

    The Distributor contains a configurable number of PacketHandler instances, each in its own thread, for connection pooling. 
    PacketHandler instances are recycled of they let escape an AhuException.

    The PacketHandler implements the RFC1034 algorithm and converts question packets into DNSBackend queries.

    A DNSBackend is an entity that returns DNSResourceRecord objects in return to explicit questions for domains with a specified QType

    PowerDNS uses the UeberBackend as its DNSBackend. The UeberBackend by default has no DNSBackends within itself, those are loaded
    using the pdns_control tool. This way DNSBackend implementations can be kept completely separate (but they often aren't).s

    If one or more DNSBackends are loaded, the UeberBackend fields the queries to all of them until one answers.

    \section TCP TCP Operations

    The TCP operation runs within a single thread called tcpreceiver(), that also queries the PacketHandler. 

    \section Cache Caching
 
    On its own, this setup is not suitable for high performance operations. A single DNS query can turn into many DNSBackend questions,
    each taking many miliseconds to complete. This is why the qthread() first checks the PacketCache to see if an answer is known to a packet
    asking this question. If so, the entire Distributor is shunted, and the answer is sent back *directly*, within a few microseconds.

    \section misc Miscellaneous
    Configuration details are available via the ArgvMap instance arg. Statistics are created by making calls to the StatBag object called S. 
    These statistics are made available via the UeberBackend on the same socket that is used for dynamic module commands.

    \section Main Main 
    The main() of PowerDNS can be found in receiver.cc - start reading there for further insights into the operation of the nameserver
