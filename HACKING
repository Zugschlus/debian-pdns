To compile from cvs, do:

$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anon@outpost.ds9a.nl:/var/cvsroot
$ cvs login
CVS password: [enter 'cvs' (without 's)]
$ cvs co pdns
cvs server: Updating pdns
...

And then:

$ ./bootstrap

you may need to do that twice. You also need libtool-1.4, 1.3 won't work.
Automake 1.6 is (almost) required.

Send any patches you may have to the mailinglist:
                        pdns-dev@mailman.powerdns.com
Preferred form is:

$ cvs -z3 diff -uBb

Thanks!
