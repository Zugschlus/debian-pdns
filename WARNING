Warning!

This version is a regression on 2.8 for almost everybody except open source
developers. Please do not blindly install 2.9 over 2.8.

2.9 is the first open source consolidation release, we expect things to
clear up after 2.9 and to fully stabilise at 3.0.

Currently, only static modules are supported in the build process!
