pdns_record should have logging family setting

bind2backend should eb documented somewhat

THIS IS NOT UP TO DATE AND CONTAINS RANDOM RAMBLING
---------------------------------------------------


* new zone is AXFRed, written to disk succesfully
	probably? unsure
* the old SOA record remains in place

bugs:
	pdns.conf-dist contains old descriptions

	dynmessenger.cc unused variable warning


Things we will not do but hope other people will:
	- Ports to NetBSD, OpenBSD, AIX

	webserver has problems with 'top-100 queries' instead of top-10.

Projects we will be working on, but would like help for:

Big things:
	- new plan
Like in the old days but with a twist - additional processing is done on a
best-effort basis by a non-rd packet sent to syncres. This means we can stay
lazy for far longer!

TODO:
	learn syncres to load its roots from disk too or at completime
	get a way to nuke the cache/parts of the cache

	- Add support for TSIG

Medium size things:
	- get PDNS into FreeBSD ports
	- and other architectures	
	- test powerdns in a windows environment!


Small things, great for coders new to PowerDNS:
done	- add LOC record
	- add KEY record
	- add SIG record
done	- get the xdb backend building again
	- 'make distclean' tries to calculate dependencies in
		modules/pgmysqlbackend, which is not needed
	- remove 'handle' from UeberBackend and BindBackend
