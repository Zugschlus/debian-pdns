THIS IS NOT UP TO DATE AND CONTAINS RANDOM RAMBLING
---------------------------------------------------

Older stuff below:

* new zone is AXFRed, written to disk successfully
	probably? unsure
* the old SOA record remains in place

bugs:
	pdns.conf-dist contains old descriptions

	dynmessenger.cc unused variable warning

Things we will not do but hope other people will:
	- Ports to NetBSD, OpenBSD, AIX

	webserver has problems with 'top-100 queries' instead of top-10.

Projects we will be working on, but would like help for:

Big things:
	- new plan
Like in the old days but with a twist - additional processing is done on a
best-effort basis by a non-rd packet sent to syncres. This means we can stay
lazy for far longer!

TODO:
	learn syncres to load its roots from disk too or at completime
	get a way to nuke the cache/parts of the cache

	- Add support for TSIG

Small things, great for coders new to PowerDNS:
	- remove 'handle' from UeberBackend and BindBackend
